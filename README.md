# node-s2

Bindings for the [S2 Geometry Library](https://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/) into
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

This fork is designed to work with [Xy Group's LMDB Library with Buffer keys](https://github.com/xygroup/node-lmdb-buffer) and exposes
helper functions only, *not* the S2 library itself.

For usage information, see the examples in the `test/` directory.
